# FFmpeg-DirectX-Player-Demo

A minimal C++ project showing how to decode video using FFmpeg and render using DirectX on Windows.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- FFmpeg (decode)
- DirectX 11 (render)
- MFC (optional UI wrapper)
- Built with MSVC 2019

## 📦 Features
- Load and decode H264/MP4
- Render frames to DirectX surface
- Handles basic frame drop/resync

## 🧠 Why I Built This
Many devs struggle to bridge FFmpeg and DirectX. I built this to simplify integration and give clean, real-world code.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon
- Audio sync
- GStreamer input
- GUI front-end
